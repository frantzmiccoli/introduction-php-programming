Well, well, well, what do we have here?
========

This repository contains a basic course of programming through PHP.

Why PHP?
========

Because I think web programming is the easiest to bring new joiners to the realm of creation through code and because PHP is the most common web languages (with many tools on every platform and super cheap hosting).

JavaScript could also have match the above description (at least for client side development), however JavaScript is one of the toughest language I can think about. I won't try to teach it to neophyte since most of the professional I meet don't actually understand what they do, and what could be a program end up in being a chaining of callbacks and JQuery selectors.
