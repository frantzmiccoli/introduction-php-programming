Well, well, well, what do we have here?
========

This repository contains an introductory course of programming through PHP.

To access it just go to the [GitHub page](http://frantzmiccoli.github.io/introduction-php-programming/ "Introduction to PHP and programming")

Why PHP?
========

Because I think web programming is the easiest to bring new joiners to the realm of creation through code and because PHP is the most common web languages (with many tools on every platform and super cheap hosting).

JavaScript could also have match the above description (at least for client side development), however JavaScript is one of the toughest language I can think about. I won't try to teach it to neophyte since most of the professional I meet don't actually understand what they do, and what could be a program end up in being a chaining of callbacks and JQuery selectors.

Reuse this
==========

As a teacher
------------

I don't think humanity will get worse if more people understand how to program and start to create things, even small ones. Feel free to reuse this course, however beware of the specific licenses of the pictures in the deck they may not suit what you want to do.

As a learner
------------

This material is not intended to be understood without having someone to guide you. You can easily find better resource to learn (ask a friend, Twitter or Google to find something that suits you)
